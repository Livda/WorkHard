What we use :

```
Client                  Server
------                  ------

Workbench -------------> DBMS
```

There is 2 equivalent ways to connect on a server : the _IP adress_ or the
_server name_. The link between this two things is the _DNS_
(Domain Name System), which translate server name in an IP adress.
